# Pizza-Ordering-System
A straightforward pizza ordering system that utilizes class inheritance and polymorphism. There are three files:

MainPizza.java
          
              The control program

Pizza.java

              The Pizza class definiton
              
Cheese.java

               Extends the Pizza class

The control program requests the pizza type from the user (Meat or Cheese).
If the user selects cheese, an order is automatically placed for a $6 thin crust cheese pizza.
If the user selects meat, the program asks for more information (eg. topping) and adjusts the cost accordingly.
